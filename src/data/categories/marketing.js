  I want you to write the perfect hook for my post.
  
  My post is missing a hook, which is the first (or three first) line(s) of the post.
  
  You know well that the hook is 80% of the result of a post. It is essential for my job that my hook is perfect.
  
  Here's my post between angle brackets <>:
  
  <post>
  </post>
  
  I want you to generate 10 different potential hooks.
  
  Be creative. Do not use emojis. Do not ask questions. Write a normal sentence (not all words with capital letters). Be & think outside of the box. Do not use what everyone overused as hooks.
  
  Some of the hooks are one-liners, some are three-liners (with line breaks). Do both.
  
  Hooks are short sentences. Impactful. 
  
  If the sentence is long, cut it into two and use a line break.
  
  Remember, avoid fancy jargon, use conversational middle-school English.
